YOU MAY OPT OUT OF THE BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER AS PROVIDED BELOW.</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li4">Platforms Intended for General Use.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p2">By using any Platform, you represent, acknowledge and agree that you are at least 18 years of age, or if you are under 18 years of age but are at least 16 years old (a "<b>Minor</b>"), that you are using the Platform with the consent of your parent or legal guardian and that you have received your parent's or legal guardian's permission to agree to these Terms. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a Minor, you hereby agree to bind the Minor to these Terms and to fully indemnify and hold harmless HJPT if the Minor breaches any of these Terms. Our Platforms are not targeted toward, nor intended for use by, anyone under the age of 16. If you are not at least 16 years old, you may not use our Platforms at any time or in any manner, nor may you submit any information to HJPT.</p>
<p class="p2">HJPT provides content through the Platforms that is copyrighted and/or trademarked work of HJPT, HJPT's third-party licensors and suppliers, or other users of the Platforms (collectively, the "<b>Materials</b>"). Materials may include logos, graphics, video, images, software and other content. Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, and your compliance with these Terms, HJPT hereby grants you a limited, personal, non-exclusive and non-transferable license to use and to display the Materials and to use the Platforms solely for your personal use. Except for the foregoing license (and the license set forth in the section below entitled Mobile Applications), you have no other rights in the Platforms or any Materials and you may not modify, edit, copy, reproduce, create derivative works of, reverse engineer, alter, enhance or in any way exploit any Platform or any Materials in any manner.</p>
<p class="p2">If you breach any of these Terms, the above license will terminate automatically and you must immediately destroy any downloaded or printed Materials.</p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li4">Use of Platforms and Services.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p2">You need not register with HJPT to simply visit and view the Platforms and use many of the Services available on the Platforms. However, HJPT may from time to time require you to register for an account with HJPT in order to access certain password-restricted areas of a Platform and to use certain Services and Materials offered on and through a Platform.</p>
<p class="p2">If account registration is offered and you desire to register for an account with HJPT, you may be required to submit information through the Platform, which information may include your e-mail address, name and mailing address. You may also have the ability to provide additional optional information about yourself, which is not required to register for the account, but may be helpful to HJPT in providing you with a more customized experience when using the Platforms or the Services they provide. Once you have submitted your account registration information, HJPT shall have the right to approve or reject the requested account, in HJPT's discretion. If your account is approved, you will be permitted to log in to the applicable Platform(s) or Service(s) using the password you select.</p>
<p class="p2">You may also be provided with the ability to register for an account on the Platform using your existing account and log-in credentials through certain Third-Party Sites (as defined below) such as Facebook.</p>
<p class="p2">You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your HJPT password and any Third-Party Site password used to access our Platforms and/or Services (collectively, "<b>Passwords</b>"), and you are responsible for all activities that occur using your Passwords. You agree not to share your Passwords, let others access or use your Passwords, or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your Passwords. You agree to notify HJPT if any of your Passwords are lost or stolen, if you are aware of any unauthorized use of your Passwords or if you know of any other breach of security in relation to any Platform. All the information that you provide when registering for an account and otherwise through the Platforms must be accurate, complete and up to date. You may change, correct or remove any information from your account by logging into your account directly and making the desired changes.</p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li4">Purchases.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p2">If applicable, you agree to pay all fees or charges associated with your use of the Platforms or purchases made through the Platforms pursuant to any HJPT billing terms in effect as shown on the applicable product or payment pages. If you do not pay on time or if HJPT cannot charge your credit card or other applicable payment method for any reason, HJPT reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your access to any or all of the Platforms and/or your account, and terminate these Terms. You are expressly agreeing that HJPT is permitted to bill you for the applicable fees, any applicable tax and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the Platforms and that fees will be billed to your credit card or other HJPT-approved payment method. If the product or service you have purchased involves a subscription or recurring payments, you agree that HJPT may charge your credit card or other HJPT-approved payment method thereafter at regular intervals for the term of the recurring payments. Except as otherwise set forth in these Terms or separate product purchase terms on a Platform, all fees and charges are non-refundable. If you have a balance due on any account, you agree that HJPT may charge such unpaid fees to your credit card or other payment method, or otherwise bill you for such unpaid fees.</p>
<p class="p2">All prices displayed on the Platforms are quoted in U.S. dollars. Shipping and handling fees and applicable sales/use tax will be added by HJPT as necessary. HJPT reserves the right to make changes to pricing and specifications without prior notice and without incurring any obligations to you, and to restrict delivery to addresses within the United States. HJPT reserves the right to limit the number of items ordered and to refuse services to any customer without prior notification. In the event that an item lists an incorrect price, either due to typographical or other error, HJPT shall have the right to refuse or cancel any order placed for the incorrect price, regardless of whether the order is being or has been processed. If payment has already been made or if a credit card has already been charged for the purchase and the order is cancelled, HJPT shall promptly credit the credit card account in the amount of the incorrect price.</p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li4">Electronic Communications.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p2">By using a Platform and/or Service, you consent to receiving electronic communications from HJPT. These electronic communications may include notices about applicable fees and charges, transactional information and other information concerning or related to the Platform and/or Service provided on or through the Platform. These electronic communications are part of your relationship with HJPT. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures or other communications that we send you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing.</p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li4">Privacy Policy.</li>

Certain areas of a Platform may allow you to interact and/or conduct transactions with such Third-Party Sites and/or allow you to configure your privacy settings in your Third-Party Site account to permit your activities on our Platform to be shared with your contacts in your Third-Party Site account. In certain situations, you may be transferred to a Third-Party Site through a link but it may appear that you are still on our Platform. In any case, you acknowledge and agree that the Third-Party Sites may have different privacy policies and terms and conditions of use than are found on our Platforms, and you further acknowledge and agree that, in such cases, your use of such Third-Party Sites is governed by such third party privacy policies and terms and conditions of use. HJPT provides links to Third-Party Sites to you as a convenience, and we do not verify, make any representations about, or take responsibility for such Third-Party Sites, including, without limitation, the truthfulness, accuracy, quality or completeness of the content, services, links displayed and/or any other activities conducted on or through such Third-Party Sites. YOU AGREE THAT HJPT WILL NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY GOODS, SERVICES, INFORMATION, RESOURCES AND/OR CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH ANY THIRD-PARTY SITES, FOR YOUR DEALINGS OR COMMUNICATIONS WITH ANY THIRD PARTIES, OR FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LOSS CAUSED OR ALLEGED TO BE CAUSED BY OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OR RELIANCE ON THE CONTENT, PRODUCTS, SERVICES OR BUSINESS PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD PARTY. Unless specifically stated on our Platform, we do not endorse any such Third-Party Sites, the products, services, or materials found there, or any results that may be obtained from using them.</p>

<p class="p2">You are responsible for the information, opinions, messages, comments, photos, videos, graphics, sounds and other content or material that you submit, upload, post, create or otherwise generate or make available on or through any of our Platforms or Services (each a "<b>Submission</b>"). You may not upload, post or otherwise generate or make available to us any material protected by copyright, trademark, or any other proprietary right without the express permission of the owner of such copyright, trademark or other proprietary right, and the burden of determining whether any material is protected by any such right is on you. You shall be solely liable for any damage resulting from any infringement of copyrights, trademarks, proprietary rights, violation of contract, privacy or publicity rights or any other harm resulting from any Submission that you make. You have full responsibility for each Submission you make, including its legality, reliability and appropriateness.</p>

You hereby grant to HJPT, its affiliates, successors and assigns and any customer, vendor, service provider, licensor or licensee of HJPT or other person, in each case as authorized or permitted by HJPT (collectively "<b>Business Partners</b>," and together with HJPT, its affiliates and any of their licensees, the "<b>Licensees</b>") a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide license (including the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to use, reproduce, process, adapt, publicly perform, publicly display, modify, prepare derivative works, publish, transmit and distribute each of your Submissions, or any portion thereof, in any form, medium or distribution method now known or hereafter existing, known or developed, for any purpose, including without limitation, any purpose relating to the Platforms and/or the Services or the marketing, advertising and promotion of HJPT's goods and services. Said uses may include, but are not limited to, posting a Submission on any website or social media site, transmitting the Submissions to consumers via e-mail and reproducing, displaying the Submissions on computers and mobile devices or reproducing your Submissions in print. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you waive and agree not to assert any and all copyright rights, moral rights or rights of attribution and integrity in your Submissions, if any, against any Licensee. Any Licensee may modify or adapt your Submissions in order to transmit, display or distribute them over computer networks and in various media and/or make changes to the Submissions as necessary to conform and adapt them to any requirements or limitations of any networks, devices, services or media. HJPT agrees to use any personally identifiable information contained in any of your Submissions in accordance with HJPT's <span class="s2">Privacy Policy</span>.</p>
<p class="p2">You agree to pay for all royalties, fees, damages and any other monies owing any person by reason of any Submissions you provide.</p>
<p class="p2">When you provide Submissions you agree that those Submissions shall not be in violation of the "<b>Unauthorized Activities</b>" section immediately below.

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Introduction</b></span><b>.</b></p>
<p class="p2">This "<b>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration; Class Action Waive</b>r" provision (this "<b>Provision</b>") facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and HJPT. Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision. You have the right to opt-out of this Provision (as explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury.</p>
<p class="p2">Please read this Provision carefully. It provides that all Disputes (as defined below) between you and HJPT shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). Except as otherwise provided, entering into this agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorneys' fees).</p>
<p class="p2">For the purpose of this Provision, "<b>HJPT</b>" means Tre Milano, LLC, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents. The term "<b>Dispute</b>" means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and HJPT regarding any aspect of your relationship with HJPT, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below). "<b>Dispute</b>" is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as HJPT's licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.</p>
<p class="p2">With respect to any Dispute, you will be deemed to have consented to this Provision upon the first occurrence of any of the following, in connection with and as relevant to your claim: (1) your access or other use of the harryjoshprotools.com website or any other Platform, (2) your access or other use of any Service; (3) your purchase of any HJPT product or accessory; (4) your receipt of your purchase of any HJPT product or accessory; or (5) any act or omission, by HJPT, giving rise to the Dispute.</p>
<p class="p2">YOU AND HJPT EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</b></span></p>
<p class="p2">For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give HJPT an opportunity to resolve the Dispute. You must commence this process by calling HJPT toll-free at (877) 891-2145 or writing us at HJPT, 2730 Monterey St., Ste. 101, Torrance, CA 90503, Attention: Legal. When you contact us, you must provide (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you are seeking. If HJPT does not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration. You may pursue your Dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out</b></span></p>
<p class="p2">Notwithstanding the above, you or HJPT may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if (a) the Dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in small claims court; or (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN <span class="s1">30 DAYS FROM</span> THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENTED TO THIS AGREEMENT, AS DESCRIBED IN THE INTRODUCTION, ABOVE (the "<b>Opt-Out Deadline</b>"). You may opt out of this Provision by mailing written notification to Harry Josh Pro Tools, c/o Tre Milano, LLC, 2730 Monterey St., Ste. 101, Torrance, CA 90503, Attention: Legal. Your written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with HJPT through arbitration. Your decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with HJPT. Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your Dispute in arbitration or small claims court.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Arbitration Procedures</b></span></p>
<p class="p2">If this Provision applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution), either you or HJPT may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration Association ("<b>AAA</b>"), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Provision.</p>
<p class="p2">For arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. In either instance, the AAA's Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply. The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267. This Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.</p>
<p class="p2">The Federal Arbitration Act ("<b>FAA</b>") shall be deemed to govern the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.</p>
<p class="p2">Arbitration Award – The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator will make any award in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.</p>
<p class="p2">Location of Arbitration – You or HJPT may initiate arbitration in either the County of Los Angeles, State of California or the federal judicial district that includes your billing address. In the event that you select the federal judicial district that includes your billing address, HJPT may transfer the arbitration to the County of Los Angeles, State of California, in the event that it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the transfer, as determined by the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="p2">Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs – HJPT will pay all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator's costs and expenses upon your written request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration. You are responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses. Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Class Action Waiver</span></p>
<p class="p2">Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and HJPT specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration. If you choose to pursue your Dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other user of any Platform can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Jury Waiver</span></p>
<p class="p2">You understand and agree that by entering into this Agreement you and HJPT are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court. In the absence of this Provision, you and HJPT might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions). Except as otherwise provided below, those rights are waived. Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited or may also be waived.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Severability</span></p>
<p class="p2">If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision, and the remainder of this Provision will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Continuation</span></p>
<p class="p2">This Provision shall survive the termination of your service with HJPT or its affiliates. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if HJPT makes any change to this Provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change and require HJPT to adhere to the language in this Provision if a dispute between us arises.</p>
